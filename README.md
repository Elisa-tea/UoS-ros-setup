## Docker Setup

### Windows ü™ü
This repository is not tested on Windows (yet). However, you can follow the steps below to setup the ROS environment on your Windows machine. 
1. Make sure you have the GlobalProtect VPN client installed and connected to the University of Surrey's network. See [here](uos_vpn_setup.pdf) for more information.

2. Run the following command to pull the image from the University of Surrey's container registry and tag it as `uos-ros-setup:latest`.
    ```bash
    docker pull container-registry.surrey.ac.uk/shared-containers/robotics-module-2:latest
    docker tag container-registry.surrey.ac.uk/shared-containers/robotics-module-2:latest uos-robotics:latest
    ```
    Alternatively, if you don't want to setup the VPN, you can pull from OSRF's official image:
    ```bash
    docker pull osrf/ros:melodic-desktop-full
    ```

    **Be mindful that both of these images are amd64 images.** 
    If you're using M1 Macs, Docker uses QEMU to emulate the amd64 architecture on your machine. This can cause some unintended side effects so I highly advise the custom built image provided in this repository.

### Apple Sillicon üçé
The `Dockerfile` in this repository uses `arm64v8/ros:melodic-ros-base-bionic` as the base image. You can build and tag this image by running:
```bash
make build
```

#### X11 Forwarding
First, make sure you have `XQuartz` installed on your machine. You can follow the guide [here](https://gist.github.com/sorny/969fe55d85c9b0035b0109a31cbcb088).
```bash
brew install xquartz
```
Make sure you restart the machine after the installation.
Then, you need to make sure `Allow connections from network clients` is checked in the `Security` tab of the `XQuartz` preferences.

Running `xeyes` should open up a window with eyes following your cursor.

If you need to debug your xquartz installation,
```bash
launchctl getenv DISPLAY
echo $DISPLAY
```
Both of these commands should yield you something like this `/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.MlblcvUafR/org.xquartz:0`.


You can also choose to explicitly set the `~/.zshrc` to export the `DISPLAY` variable to `:0`. 
```bash
export DISPLAY=":0"
```
This might solve the issue, but it also indicates there are some problems prohibing the X11 server from starting up. Usually it's due to accidentally disabling `XQuartz` in your `Login Items and Extensions` in your `System Preferences`.
